# bayesian-elastic

This repository holds the main codes deveoped for and reported in the manuscript "Bayesian inference for the Young's modulus parameter field in an elastic model of slender structures" by Soheil Fatehiboroujeni, Noemi Petra, Sachin Goyal at University of California, Merced.

The codes need to be compiled in conjunction with the hyppilib version 1.0.1 (https://hippylib.github.io/download/) which is an Inverse Problem PYthon library.
